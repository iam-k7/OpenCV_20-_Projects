# OpenCV 20+ Projects

A collection of hands-on **OpenCV computer vision projects** in Python, designed to help you learn image and video processing from basics to advanced topics. Each day adds new code examples demonstrating different vision techniques using OpenCV. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

This project covers a range of computer vision topics with OpenCV, including:

✔️ Image loading and display  
✔️ Video capture and processing  
✔️ Drawing and transformation on images  
✔️ Object detection techniques  
✔️ Deep learning based detection using DNN modules  
✔️ Practical examples you can expand on

These examples help cement core CV concepts so you can build real applications like:
- face detection
- object tracking
- edge detection
- video analytics and more

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 💡 Requirements

Install Python 3.7+ and then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


---

✅ **Tips for improvement:**

1. Add a short description for each script (Day-01 to Day-07).
2. Include sample output images / screenshots.
3. Add badges — e.g., build status, license, Python version.

If you want, I can tailor this `README.md` further (with badges and per-script descriptions). Just share brief details of each file.
